            <h2>Network Infrastructure Upgrades</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The NSLS-II facility has transitioned to an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) model for its network stack. This includes the use of vCenter and Satellite to manage local data centers and virtual servers, providing a flexible and scalable infrastructure to support various applications and services.</li>
                <li>This virtualization model enables central deployment of tools and configurations, improving system efficiency. It also enhances cybersecurity by providing better control and protection over the system components.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Systems-Focused Test Benches</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed and implemented test bench environments replicating production configurations, ensuring seamless live spare availability.</li>
                <li>Enabled groups like Vacuum, RF, and Diagnostics to test upgrades, troubleshoot issues, and validate tools in a controlled, isolated environment.</li>
                <li>Minimized risks to production systems by keeping test benches completely separate from live environments.</li>
                <li>Established a standard framework adopted across multiple teams, improving efficiency and reliability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>AI-Assisted Accelerator Timing System</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Used AI-assisted development to design and implement Ethernet-based EPICS IOCs, replacing deprecated 3100 CPUs and RTEMS. This modernization improved reliability, enabled remote diagnostics, and enhanced system scalability while eliminating reliance on aging VME-based infrastructure.</li>
                <li>Developed a new device driver for MRF230 series timing modules, leveraging AI-generated code optimizations to streamline implementation and reduce development time. The transition to an Ethernet-based architecture provided greater flexibility in control, remote management, and integration with existing accelerator infrastructure.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="project">
            <h2>Power Supply Controller (PSC) Controls Development</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed and deployed EPICS IOCs for modular PSC systems supporting power supply control infrastructure at both BNL and LBNL.</li>
                <li>Contributed to the ALS-U project at LBNL by integrating PSC controls that provide precise, reliable power regulation for accelerator environments.</li>
                <li>Developed a custom EPICS IOC and Phoebus interface for Tripp Lite PDUs, enabling remote monitoring, power cycling, and streamlined management of rack-mounted hardware within accelerator control systems.</li>
                <li>Developed and supported control system integration to enhance diagnostics, reliability, and maintainability across multiple lab environments.</li>
            </ul>
