            <h2>Power Supply Controller (PSC) Controls Development</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Contributed to the <a href="https://als.lbl.gov/als-u/" target="_blank">ALS-U project</a> at LBNL as part of the Osprey DCS team, 
                    focusing on the integration and deployment of advanced Power Supply Controller (PSC) systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Designed and deployed modular 
                    <a href="https://epics-controls.org/" target="_blank">EPICS</a> IOCs to control and monitor PSCs, ensuring high-precision power regulation 
                    for accelerator magnets and supporting systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Developed user-facing 
                    <a href="https://control-system-studio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">Phoebus</a> GUIs to provide streamlined visibility and 
                    intuitive control of PSC states, interlocks, and diagnostics.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Supported power supply integration efforts across BNL and LBNL by standardizing control infrastructure and improving reliability, 
                    maintainability, and real-time response.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Additionally, created a custom EPICS IOC and Phoebus interface for Tripp Lite PDUs, enabling remote monitoring, outlet-level 
                    power cycling, and improved rack-level power management.

            <h2>Network Infrastructure Upgrades</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    As part of the 
                    <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/nsls2/datascience/" target="_blank">NSLS-II Data Science and Systems Integration (DSSI)</a> group, 
                    I contributed to major network infrastructure improvements supporting accelerator operations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The NSLS-II facility has transitioned to an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) model for its network stack. 
                    This includes the use of vCenter and Satellite to manage local data centers and virtual servers, providing a flexible and scalable 
                    infrastructure to support various applications and services.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This virtualization model enables centralized deployment of tools and configurations, improving system efficiency. 
                    It also enhances cybersecurity by offering greater control and protection over critical system components.

            <h2>AI-Assisted Accelerator Timing System</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Used AI-assisted development to design and implement Ethernet-based EPICS IOCs, replacing deprecated 3100 CPUs and RTEMS. This modernization improved reliability, enabled remote diagnostics, and enhanced system scalability while eliminating reliance on aging VME-based infrastructure.</li>
                <li>Developed a new device driver for MRF230 series timing modules, leveraging AI-generated code optimizations to streamline implementation and reduce development time. The transition to an Ethernet-based architecture provided greater flexibility in control, remote management, and integration with existing accelerator infrastructure.</li>
