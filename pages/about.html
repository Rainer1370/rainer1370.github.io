            <h1>About Rob Rainer – Senior Controls Engineer & EPICS Specialist</h1>
            <img src="/assets/Profile.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" class="profile-pic">
            <p>
                I’m Rob Rainer, a Senior Technology Engineer with over 20 years of experience across private industry and U.S. national laboratories. 
                My expertise spans materials science, accelerator and data systems, EPICS-based control systems, AI/ML integration, and facility operations optimization.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hold a Bachelor of Science in Physics and a Master of Science in Engineering, giving me a solid foundation in both theoretical physics and applied engineering. 
                This background has empowered me to drive innovation in accelerator operations and control systems development.
            </p>
            <p>
                My work has included managing critical accelerator infrastructure, transitioning systems to secure virtualized environments, 
                and modernizing operations through advanced software tools and automation. I’ve contributed to multidisciplinary projects at 
                Brookhaven, Oak Ridge, Argonne, and Berkeley National Labs, and provided consulting and IT services to private organizations across sectors.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m passionate about mentoring junior engineers and interns, and I strive to cultivate a collaborative, forward-thinking environment. 
                Outside of work, I’m a committed human rights advocate and actively support environmental and humanitarian causes.

            <h2>My Critical Systems (EPICS-based)</h2>
            <p>
                As a Senior Technology Engineer, I recently managed several critical systems essential to the smooth operation of NSLS-II at BNL:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Utilities Systems:</strong> Supporting accelerator and facility performance through reliable, monitored operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Vacuum Systems:</strong> Maintaining beamline and accelerator integrity via high-efficiency vacuum environments.</li>
                <li><strong>EPS (Equipment Protection System):</strong> Protecting personnel and equipment with redundant, fail-safe systems.</li>
                <li><strong>PPS (Personnel Protection System):</strong> Ensuring safety across NSLS-II through secure and efficient interlocks.</li>
                <li><strong>Timing System:</strong> Developing and maintaining synchronized timing systems for accelerator coordination.</li>
                <li><strong>Operations IOCs and GUIs:</strong> Creating tailored EPICS IOCs and intuitive GUIs for streamlined control and diagnostics.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>My Professional Journey</h2>
            <p>
                My journey in science and engineering spans diverse fields, from advanced materials research to modern accelerator operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                I began as a Laboratory Supervisor at West Chester University of Pennsylvania, using advanced electron microscopy techniques 
                for my undergraduate thesis on materials characterization. After earning my Bachelor of Science in Physics in 2007, 
                I joined a Materials R&D lab focused on solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and photovoltaics to advance renewable energy technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2010, I transitioned to <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/" target="_blank">Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL)</a>, starting at NSLS-I 
                as an operations coordinator and accelerator operator. During this time, I completed my Master of Science in Engineering. At NSLS-I, 
                I supported beamline operations and coordinated experiments. With the commissioning of NSLS-II, I contributed to its <em>First Light</em> 
                milestone by developing EPICS-based GUIs, commissioning both the injector and storage ring, and helping establish the operations center infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
                I joined the NSLS-II Accelerator Controls Group in 2020 and took ownership of several mission-critical systems. I introduced modern 
                cybersecurity practices, led the transition to a virtualized controls infrastructure, and implemented AI/ML tools to support intelligent 
                automation and fault prediction. My contributions ensured improved reliability and efficiency across NSLS-II operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Earlier this year, I joined <a href="https://ospreydcs.com" target="_blank">Osprey DCS</a>, where I now work on control systems projects 
                for multiple national laboratories — including continued efforts at BNL, as well as EPICS development and integration at 
                <a href="https://als.lbl.gov/" target="_blank">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)</a>. My current focus includes designing, 
                deploying, and modernizing instrumentation and controls infrastructure across highly specialized environments. I am actively contributing 
                to the <a href="https://als.lbl.gov/als-u/" target="_blank">ALS-U project</a>, where I support the integration and deployment of EPICS-based 
                IOCs and GUIs for advanced Power Supply Controllers (PSCs), ensuring precision, reliability, and operational readiness for the upgraded 
                accelerator systems.
