            <p>
                I am Rob Rainer, a Senior Technology Engineer with over 15 years of experience at Brookhaven National Laboratory. 
                My expertise spans EPICS-based control systems, accelerator operations, AI/ML integration, and system optimization.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hold a Bachelor of Science in Physics and a Master of Science in Engineering, equipping me with a robust foundation 
                in both theoretical physics and practical engineering. This academic and professional background has allowed me to contribute 
                meaningfully to the advancement of accelerator operations and control systems engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                My responsibilities include managing critical accelerator systems, transitioning infrastructure to a secure virtualization model, 
                and modernizing operations through advanced tools and technologies. I have also been actively involved in applying AI/ML techniques 
                to accelerator research and automation processes. My work has also involved collaborations with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Argonne National Laboratory, where I contributed to multidisciplinary projects. Additionally, I have provided consulting and IT services to private organizations, leveraging my expertise across industries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond my technical contributions, I am passionate about mentoring junior engineers and interns, fostering a collaborative and innovative 
                environment for the next generation of professionals.

            <h2>My Professional Journey</h2>
            <p>
                My journey in science and engineering spans diverse fields, from advanced materials research to leading-edge accelerator operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                I began as a Laboratory Supervisor at West Chester University of Pennsylvania, using advanced electron microscopy techniques 
                for my undergraduate thesis on materials characterization. After earning my Bachelor of Science in Physics in 2007, 
                I joined a Materials R&D lab, conducting research on solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and photovoltaics to advance alternative energy technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2010, I transitioned to <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/" target="_blank">Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL)</a>, starting at NSLS-I as an operations coordinator and accelerator operator. During this time, I earned my Master of Science in Engineering. At NSLS-I, I supported beamline operations and coordinated experiments. 
                With the commissioning of NSLS-II, I contributed to its <em>First Light</em> success by developing EPICS-based GUIs, commissioning the injector and storage ring, and establishing the operations center infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
                I joined the NSLS-II Accelerator Controls Group in 2020 and took ownership of several critical systems. I integrated modern cybersecurity practices, transitioned infrastructure to a virtualization model, and applied AI/ML techniques to cutting-edge accelerator research. My system administration and control integration work helped ensure the reliability and optimization of NSLS-II’s critical infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Earlier this year, I joined <a href="https://ospreydcs.com" target="_blank">Osprey DCS</a>, where I now work on projects for multiple national laboratories — including continuing efforts at BNL as well as controls integration and EPICS development at <a href="https://als.lbl.gov/" target="_blank">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)</a>. My work spans the design, deployment, and modernization of control systems and instrumentation infrastructure across diverse environments.
