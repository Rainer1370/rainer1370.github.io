            <p>
                I’m Rob Rainer, a Senior Technology Engineer with over 20 years of experience across private industry and U.S. national laboratories. 
                My expertise spans materials science, accelerator and data systems, EPICS-based control systems, AI/ML integration, and facility operations optimization.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hold a Bachelor of Science in Physics and a Master of Science in Engineering, giving me a solid foundation in both theoretical physics and applied engineering. 
                This background has empowered me to drive innovation in accelerator operations and control systems development.
            </p>
            <p>
                My work has included managing critical accelerator infrastructure, transitioning systems to secure virtualized environments, 
                and modernizing operations through advanced software tools and automation. I’ve contributed to multidisciplinary projects at 
                Brookhaven, Oak Ridge, Argonne, and Berkeley National Labs, and provided consulting and IT services to private organizations across sectors.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m passionate about mentoring junior engineers and interns, and I strive to cultivate a collaborative, forward-thinking environment. 
                Outside of work, I’m a committed human rights advocate and actively support environmental and humanitarian causes.

            <p>
                As a Senior Technology Engineer, I’ve overseen several mission-critical systems that ensure reliable and safe accelerator operations at NSLS-II:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Utilities Systems:</strong> Supporting accelerator and facility performance with reliable operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Vacuum Systems:</strong> Maintaining beamline and accelerator integrity through optimized vacuum environments.</li>
                <li><strong>EPS (Equipment Protection System):</strong> Safeguarding equipment and personnel through robust safety systems.</li>
                <li><strong>PPS (Personnel Protection System):</strong> Ensuring safe access and interlocks across the NSLS-II accelerator complex.</li>
                <li><strong>Timing System:</strong> Developing and maintaining precise synchronization systems for accelerator operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Operations IOCs and GUIs:</strong> Designing intuitive GUIs and custom IOCs to support real-time control and diagnostics.</li>

            <h2>My Professional Journey</h2>
            <p>
                My journey in science and engineering spans diverse fields, from advanced materials research to leading-edge accelerator operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                I began as a Laboratory Supervisor at West Chester University of Pennsylvania, using advanced electron microscopy techniques 
                for my undergraduate thesis on materials characterization. After earning my Bachelor of Science in Physics in 2007, 
                I joined a Materials R&D lab, conducting research on solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and photovoltaics to advance alternative energy technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2010, I transitioned to <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/" target="_blank">Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL)</a>, starting at NSLS-I as an accelerator operator and experiment coordinator. During this time, I earned my Master of Science in Engineering. At NSLS-I, I supported beamline operations and coordinated experiments. 
                With the commissioning of NSLS-II, I contributed to its <em>First Light</em> success by developing EPICS GUIs, commissioning key accelerator components, and helping establish the operations center infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
                I joined the NSLS-II Accelerator Controls Group in 2020, where I took ownership of multiple core systems. I integrated modern cybersecurity standards, transitioned infrastructure to a virtualized model, and introduced AI/ML techniques to accelerator workflows.
            </p>
            <p>
                Earlier this year, I joined <a href="https://ospreydcs.com" target="_blank">Osprey DCS</a>, where I now work on projects for multiple national laboratories — including continuing efforts at BNL as well as controls integration and EPICS development at <a href="https://als.lbl.gov/" target="_blank">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)</a>. My work spans the design, deployment, and modernization of control systems and instrumentation infrastructure across diverse environments.
