            <img src="/assets/Profile.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" class="profile-pic">
            <p>
                I’m Rob Rainer, <strong>Director of Controls & Electrical Engineering at 
                <a href="https://www.sigray.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sigray Inc.</a></strong>,
                with over 20 years of experience spanning private industry and U.S. national laboratories.
                My work sits at the intersection of accelerator and instrumentation control systems,
                EPICS-based infrastructure, software architecture, and operational reliability.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hold a Bachelor of Science in Physics and a Master of Science in Engineering, providing
                a strong foundation in both theoretical principles and applied engineering practice.
                This combination has enabled me to design, modernize, and lead complex control systems
                across accelerator facilities and advanced X-ray microscopy platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my career, I have led efforts to modernize legacy control systems, transition
                critical infrastructure to secure virtualized environments, and introduce advanced
                automation and AI-assisted workflows. I have contributed to multidisciplinary projects
                at Brookhaven, Oak Ridge, Argonne, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories, and I
                continue to collaborate across industry and research environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am passionate about mentoring engineers and building strong technical teams, with a
                leadership style rooted in hands-on engineering, clear system ownership, and long-term
                maintainability. Outside of work, I support environmental and humanitarian causes and
                value thoughtful, ethical approaches to technology and leadership.

            <p>
                Over the course of my career, I have held technical ownership and leadership
                responsibility for several mission-critical systems supporting accelerator operations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Utilities Systems:</strong> Supporting accelerator and facility performance through reliable, monitored operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Vacuum Systems:</strong> Maintaining beamline and accelerator integrity via high-efficiency vacuum environments.</li>
                <li><strong>EPS (Equipment Protection System):</strong> Protecting personnel and equipment with redundant, fail-safe systems.</li>
                <li><strong>PPS (Personnel Protection System):</strong> Ensuring safety across NSLS-II through secure and efficient interlocks.</li>
                <li><strong>Timing System:</strong> Developing and maintaining synchronized timing systems for accelerator coordination.</li>
                <li><strong>Operations IOCs and GUIs:</strong> Creating tailored EPICS IOCs and intuitive GUIs for streamlined control and diagnostics.</li>

            <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
            <p>
                My career has evolved across materials science, accelerator operations, and large-scale
                control system architecture, with a consistent focus on reliability, performance, and
                operational clarity.
            </p>
            <p>
                I began my professional career as a scientist turned Laboratory Supervisor at Structure Probe Inc, affiliated with West Chester University of
                Pennsylvania. While there I conducted advanced electron microscopy research for my undergraduate
                thesis in Transmission Electron Microscopy techniques. After earning my Bachelor of Science in Physics in
                2007, I joined a materials R&amp;D laboratory focused on solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and
                photovoltaic technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2010, I joined <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/" target="_blank">Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL)</a>,
                initially supporting NSLS-I operations as an accelerator operator and operations coordinator.
                During this period, I completed my Master of Science in Engineering. I supported beamline
                operations, coordinated experiments, and later contributed to the commissioning of NSLS-II,
                including EPICS GUI development, injector and storage ring commissioning, and operations
                center infrastructure leading up to <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=111677" target="_blank">First Light.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2020, I joined the NSLS-II Accelerator Controls Group, taking ownership of multiple
                mission-critical systems. I led efforts to modernize cybersecurity practices, transition
                controls infrastructure to virtualized platforms, and introduce AI-assisted tools for
                diagnostics, automation, and fault detection, resulting in improved reliability and
                operational efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                I later joined <a href="https://ospreydcs.com" target="_blank">Osprey DCS</a>, supporting
                control system development and EPICS integration across multiple national laboratories,
                including ongoing work at BNL and <a href="https://als.lbl.gov/" target="_blank">Lawrence
                Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)</a>. This included contributions to the
                <a href="https://als.lbl.gov/als-u/" target="_blank">ALS-U upgrade</a>, where I supported
                the deployment of EPICS-based IOCs and GUIs for advanced Power Supply Controllers (PSCs).
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, at <a href="https://www.sigray.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sigray Inc.</a>,
                I lead the controls and electrical engineering divisions, overseeing system architecture,
                technical direction, and delivery of control systems for next-generation X-ray microscopy
                platforms.
