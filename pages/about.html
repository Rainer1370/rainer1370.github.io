            <p>
                I’m Rob Rainer, a Senior Technology Engineer with over 15 years of experience at Brookhaven National Laboratory. 
                My expertise spans EPICS-based control systems, accelerator operations, AI/ML integration, and large-scale system optimization.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hold a Bachelor of Science in Physics and a Master of Science in Engineering, equipping me with a solid foundation 
                in both theoretical science and applied engineering. This academic and professional background has enabled me to contribute 
                meaningfully to the advancement of accelerator operations and control systems engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                My responsibilities have included managing critical accelerator systems, transitioning infrastructure to secure virtualization models, 
                and modernizing operations through advanced tools and automation. I’ve also been deeply involved in applying AI/ML techniques 
                to accelerator research and real-time control processes. My work has included collaborations with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), 
                Argonne National Laboratory, and others — contributing to multidisciplinary, cross-institutional projects. In parallel, I’ve provided 
                consulting and IT services to private organizations, bringing my engineering and systems expertise to broader industries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond my technical work, I’m passionate about mentoring junior engineers and interns, fostering a collaborative and forward-thinking 
                environment for the next generation of professionals.

            <h2>My Critical Systems (EPICS-based)</h2>
            <p>
                As a Senior Technology Engineer, I recently managed several critical systems essential to the smooth operation of NSLS-II at BNL:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Utilities Systems:</strong> Supporting accelerator and facility performance through reliable, monitored operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Vacuum Systems:</strong> Maintaining beamline and accelerator integrity via high-efficiency vacuum environments.</li>
                <li><strong>EPS (Equipment Protection System):</strong> Protecting personnel and equipment with redundant, fail-safe systems.</li>
                <li><strong>PPS (Personnel Protection System):</strong> Ensuring safety across NSLS-II through secure and efficient interlocks.</li>
                <li><strong>Timing System:</strong> Developing and maintaining synchronized timing systems for accelerator coordination.</li>
                <li><strong>Operations IOCs and GUIs:</strong> Creating tailored EPICS IOCs and intuitive GUIs for streamlined control and diagnostics.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>My Professional Journey</h2>
            <p>
                My journey in science and engineering spans diverse fields, from advanced materials research to modern accelerator operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                I began as a Laboratory Supervisor at West Chester University of Pennsylvania, using advanced electron microscopy techniques 
                for my undergraduate thesis on materials characterization. After earning my Bachelor of Science in Physics in 2007, 
                I joined a Materials R&D lab focused on solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and photovoltaics to advance renewable energy technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2010, I transitioned to <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/" target="_blank">Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL)</a>, starting at NSLS-I 
                as an operations coordinator and accelerator operator. During this time, I completed my Master of Science in Engineering. At NSLS-I, 
                I supported beamline operations and coordinated experiments. With the commissioning of NSLS-II, I contributed to its <em>First Light</em> 
                milestone by developing EPICS-based GUIs, commissioning both the injector and storage ring, and helping establish the operations center infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
                I joined the NSLS-II Accelerator Controls Group in 2020 and took ownership of several mission-critical systems. I introduced modern 
                cybersecurity practices, led the transition to a virtualized controls infrastructure, and implemented AI/ML tools to support intelligent 
                automation and fault prediction. My contributions ensured improved reliability and efficiency across NSLS-II operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Earlier this year, I joined <a href="https://ospreydcs.com" target="_blank">Osprey DCS</a>, where I now work on control systems projects 
                for multiple national laboratories — including continued efforts at BNL, as well as EPICS development and integration at 
                <a href="https://als.lbl.gov/" target="_blank">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)</a>. My current focus includes designing, 
                deploying, and modernizing instrumentation and controls infrastructure across highly specialized environments. I am actively contributing 
                to the <a href="https://als.lbl.gov/als-u/" target="_blank">ALS-U project</a>, where I support the integration and deployment of EPICS-based 
                IOCs and GUIs for advanced Power Supply Controllers (PSCs), ensuring precision, reliability, and operational readiness for the upgraded 
                accelerator systems.
